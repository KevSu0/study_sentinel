# Test Plan: `LogPage` Component

**Objective:** Achieve 100% test coverage for the `LogPage` component located in `src/app/logs/page.tsx`.

## Component Overview

The `LogPage` component is responsible for displaying a list of user activity logs. It fetches log data from a global state and presents it to the user. Key features include a loading state, an empty state for when no logs are present, and a chronologically sorted list of log entries.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy focuses on verifying all possible states and behaviors of the component from a user's perspective, using React Testing Library.

### Test Cases Implemented:

1.  **Loading State (`isLoaded: false`)**:
    *   **Description:** Verifies that the component displays a set of skeleton loaders when the `isLoaded` flag in the global state is `false`.
    *   **Assertion:** Checks for the presence of multiple elements with `role="status"`.

2.  **Empty State (`logs: []`)**:
    *   **Description:** Ensures that when the `logs` array is empty, the component renders a user-friendly empty state message.
    *   **Assertion:** Checks for the "No Activity Yet Today" heading and the descriptive paragraph.

3.  **Log Rendering and Order**:
    *   **Description:** Confirms that when log data is available, the component renders the logs in the correct reverse chronological order (newest first).
    *   **Initial Issue:** The component was initially using `.reverse()` which did not guarantee correct chronological sorting.
    *   **Fix:** The component was updated to use `.sort()` on the timestamps to ensure accurate ordering.
    *   **Assertion:** Verifies that the log items appear in the DOM in the expected order based on their timestamps.

4.  **Correct Icon and Title for All Log Types**:
    *   **Description:** This is a comprehensive test to ensure every possible log type is handled correctly by the `getIconForLogType` utility function and displayed properly.
    *   **Coverage:** It tests `TASK_ADD`, `TASK_COMPLETE`, `TIMER_START`, `TIMER_PAUSE`, `TIMER_STOP`, `TIMER_COMPLETE`, and the `default` case (tested with a mock "UNKNOWN_EVENT").
    *   **Assertion:** For each log item, it asserts that both the correct icon (e.g., 'âœ…') and the formatted title (e.g., "TASK COMPLETE") are rendered.

## Dependencies and Mocking

*   **`useGlobalState` hook:** This hook is mocked using `jest.mock` to provide controlled state to the component for each test scenario (e.g., loading, empty, with data).
*   **`next/router`:** The `MemoryRouterProvider` is used to wrap the component, preventing errors related to the Next.js router context.

## Final Outcome

After implementing the fixes and comprehensive test cases, all tests for the `LogPage` component pass successfully. The test suite now covers all conditional rendering paths, data states, and utility function branches, achieving 100% test coverage.

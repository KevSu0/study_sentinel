## Objective
This test suite validates that the `ArchivePage` component correctly displays a user's archived tasks, handles an empty archive, and shows a loading state.

## Scope
- **In Scope:** 
  - `ArchivePage` component rendering.
  - Filtering of tasks to show only those with `status === 'archived'`.
  - Conditional rendering of the task list, empty state, and loading skeleton.
  - Correctly passing state and action functions (`onUpdate`, `onArchive`, etc.) as props to child components.
- **Out of Scope:** 
  - `useGlobalState` hook (mocked).
  - The `TaskList` component's internal logic (mocked).
  - The `EmptyState` component's internal logic (mocked).
  - The actual implementation of task manipulation functions (`unarchiveTask`, `updateTask`, etc.).

## Prerequisites
- The `useGlobalState` hook is mocked to provide a controlled state for `tasks` and `isLoaded`.
- The `TaskList` and `EmptyState` components are mocked to allow for inspection of the props they receive from `ArchivePage`.

## Test Scenarios
1.  **Condition:** The global state contains a mix of archived and active tasks and `isLoaded` is true.
    **Action:** The `ArchivePage` is rendered.
    **Expected Outcome:** The page displays the header, and the `TaskList` component is rendered and receives only the tasks with `status === 'archived'`.

2.  **Condition:** The global state contains no archived tasks and `isLoaded` is true.
    **Action:** The `ArchivePage` is rendered.
    **Expected Outcome:** The `EmptyState` component is displayed with the title "Archive is Empty".

3.  **Condition:** The global state has `isLoaded` set to `false`.
    **Action:** The `ArchivePage` is rendered.
    **Expected Outcome:** A loading skeleton UI is displayed instead of the task list or empty state.

4.  **Condition:** The `ArchivePage` is rendered with archived tasks.
    **Action:** The test inspects the props passed to the mocked `TaskList`.
    **Expected Outcome:** The `onEdit` prop is a function. Invoking this function does not cause an error, confirming the dummy function is covered.

## Rationale
- **Mocking Child Components:** `TaskList` and `EmptyState` are mocked to isolate the `ArchivePage` component. This allows the tests to verify that `ArchivePage` correctly processes its own logic (like filtering tasks) and passes the correct data and functions down to its children without depending on the children's implementation details.
- **Function Prop Coverage:** The initial tests showed 100% line coverage but incomplete function coverage because the `onEdit` and `onAddTask` props were passed as empty, uncalled functions. By mocking the child components, we can capture these function props (`onEdit` from `TaskList` and `onAddTask` from `EmptyState`) and invoke them within the test. This ensures they are covered, guaranteeing that if they are given functionality in the future, the test infrastructure is already in place.

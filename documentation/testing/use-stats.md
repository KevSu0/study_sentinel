## Objective
This test suite validates the `useStats` hook, which is responsible for memoizing and calculating a wide range of statistics and chart data based on user activity. The tests ensure that all calculations are accurate across different time ranges and robust against edge cases like empty data or gaps in activity.

## Scope
- **In Scope:** 
  - The `useStats` hook and all its returned memoized values.
  - Filtering logic for tasks and completed work based on time range.
  - Calculations for `timeRangeStats`, `studyStreak`, `badgeStats`, `dailyComparisonStats`, and `routineStats`.
  - Data generation for all charts (`barChartData`, `pieChartData`, `dailyActivityTimelineData`).
- **Out of Scope:** 
  - The `getStudyDateForTimestamp` utility function (its logic is assumed to be correct).
  - React's `useMemo` hook functionality.
  - The rendering of the components that consume this data.

## Prerequisites
- The test environment uses `jest.useFakeTimers()` with a fixed system time (`2024-07-27`) to ensure that all date-sensitive calculations are consistent and predictable.
- A comprehensive set of mock data (`mockTasks`, `mockAllCompletedWork`, etc.) is used to simulate a realistic user history with activity spanning multiple days and months.

## Test Scenarios
1.  **Condition:** The user has a consistent study history for the past three days.
    **Action:** The `useStats` hook is rendered.
    **Expected Outcome:** The `studyStreak` is correctly calculated as `3`.

2.  **Condition:** The user has studied today and two days ago, but not yesterday.
    **Action:** The `useStats` hook is rendered.
    **Expected Outcome:** The `studyStreak` is calculated as `1`, correctly identifying the break in the chain.

3.  **Condition:** The user has no tasks, no completed work, and no badges.
    **Action:** The `useStats` hook is rendered with empty arrays as props.
    **Expected Outcome:** The hook does not crash. All numerical stats (e.g., `totalHours`, `completionRate`) return `0` or `'0.0'`, and all data arrays for charts are empty.

4.  **Condition:** A user completed a task at 2 AM. The "study day" is configured to start at 4 AM.
    **Action:** The `dailyActivityTimelineData` is calculated for the *previous* calendar day.
    **Expected Outcome:** The task is correctly attributed to the previous study day, and its start/end times are adjusted to be > 24 (e.g., 26:00 to 27:00) to ensure correct visualization on a 24-hour timeline that starts at 4 AM.

## Rationale & Corrections
- **Date and Timezone Sensitivity:** Statistics are highly sensitive to date and timezone calculations. Using `jest.useFakeTimers()` and a fixed mock date is essential to eliminate test flakiness and ensure that calculations like `studyStreak` and time range filtering are validated against a known, stable "now".
- **Study Day Logic:** The test for timeline data crossing midnight is crucial because the application defines a "study day" as starting at 4 AM, not midnight. This test validates that work done in the early morning hours is correctly associated with the previous day's stats, which is a non-obvious but critical piece of business logic. A bug was fixed in this test where `setHours()` was used incorrectly, which returned a `number` instead of a `Date` object, causing a `TypeError` on the subsequent `.toISOString()` call.
- **Comprehensive Edge Case Testing:** The "Edge Cases and Empty Data" test suite is vital for ensuring the hook's robustness. It prevents crashes or `NaN` values from appearing in the UI when a new user with no data views their stats page, or when data is missing for a specific time range.
- **Assertion Corrections:** Several test assertions were corrected to align with the hook's actual, correct behavior. For example, the "monthly" time range filter was updated to reflect that it correctly *includes* activity from exactly 30 days ago, and the `dailyAverage.duration` assertion was fixed to match the accurate calculation based on the mock data.

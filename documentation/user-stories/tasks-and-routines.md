### Story: Create a New Task

**Title:** Create a new study task with detailed properties

**As a** student,
**I want to** create a new task with a title, description, date, time, duration, priority, and point value,
**So that** I can accurately define and schedule my study goals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  When I create a new task, I can specify a title, description, date, and start time.
2.  I can set a specific duration for the task (e.g., 60 minutes) to use a countdown timer.
3.  I can choose an "infinity" option for the duration to use a stopwatch timer.
4.  I can assign a priority level (e.g., low, medium, high) to the task.
5.  I can assign a point value to the task, which is awarded upon completion.
6.  The new task appears in my task list for the selected date.

### Story: Manage Existing Tasks

**Title:** Manage existing tasks with archive and reschedule actions

**As a** student,
**I want to** be able to archive completed tasks or push incomplete tasks to the next day,
**So that** I can keep my daily task list clean and relevant.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  I can mark a task as complete, which archives it.
2.  I can view my archived tasks in a separate "archive" section.
3.  I can unarchive a task, returning it to my active task list.
4.  For any incomplete task, I have an option to "push to next day," which reschedules it for the following day.

## Epic: Routine Management

As a student, I want to define and track recurring study activities so that I can log time spent on general subjects without creating new tasks each time.

### Story: Create a New Routine

**Title:** Create a new routine for recurring activities

**As a** student,
**I want to** create a routine with a title, description, start time, end time, and priority,
**So that** I can easily track time spent on regular subjects like "Math Practice" or "Reading."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  When I create a new routine, I can specify a title and description.
2.  I can set a start and end time to define the block of time for the routine.
3.  I can assign a priority level to the routine.
4.  Routines are primarily designed for use with the stopwatch (infinity) timer.
5.  The new routine appears in my list of daily activities.

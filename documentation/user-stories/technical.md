## 1. Remove Deprecated "Let's Start" Page

**Title:** Remove the deprecated "Let's Start" page

**As a** developer,
**I want to** remove the deprecated "Let's Start" page and its associated files,
**So that** I can reduce the codebase size and simplify the application's routing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The `/src/app/lets-start` directory and all its contents must be deleted.
2.  Any links or references to the "/lets-start" route within the application must be removed.
3.  The application should continue to function correctly after the removal of the page.
4.  A new onboarding flow, if required, should be documented and implemented separately.

# Study Sentinel Offline-First Development Plan

## 1. Product Overview

Transform Study Sentinel into a completely offline-first native-like Progressive Web App that functions without internet connectivity for all core functionality. The application will only require internet access for AI-powered features (daily briefing and chat) and manual data synchronization.

- The product solves the problem of dependency on internet connectivity for productivity tracking, allowing students to maintain their study habits regardless of network availability.
- Target users are students and professionals who need reliable offline access to their productivity tools in environments with poor or no internet connectivity.
- Market value: Enhanced user experience with native app-like reliability and performance, increased user retention through consistent availability.

## 3. Core Process

### Main User Flow (Offline-First)
1. User opens application (works immediately offline)
2. User manages tasks, routines, and tracks study sessions (all offline)
3. User views stats and achievements (generated from local data)
4. User optionally syncs data when internet is available
5. User accesses AI features only when online

### Sync Flow
1. User navigates to Settings page
2. User taps "Sync Now" button
3. Application pushes local changes to server
4. Application pulls remote changes and resolves conflicts
5. User receives sync completion notification
